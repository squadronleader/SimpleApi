# SimpleApi
Simple owin app that allows you to create simple web api for testing stuff.

To create a new api endpoint all you have to do is add a .json file to /Content folder.
Look at the Test.json to see what you can do. You can even define different response for requests based on the property values by creating rules.
You can also validate request schema that is passed in that will return a error response if the not matched.
